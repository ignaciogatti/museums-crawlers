# museums-crawlers

This git contains a set of crawlers. The objective of them is to get data from different museums -in general artwork's image and information about the artwork-. 

Basically, all the crawlers are developed using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). In general, Selenium is used to load the DOM as well as to deal with the dynamic content. Meanwhile, Scrapy is used to find and save the data
